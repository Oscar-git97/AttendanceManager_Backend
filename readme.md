**goal:**
- a ***teacher*** will be able to create and manage ***sessions*** that will be linked to a specific ***cours*** that is part of a ***study program***
- also each ***teacher*** will be assigned a ***bluetooth beacon***
- as soon as the ***teacher*** opens the ***session***, student will be able to verify their attendance when:
	- they are part of a ***study program*** containing that ***cours***
	- the phone they use is in the proximity of the ***beacon*** 
- alternatively, a ***qr-code*** (also linked to a ***teacher***)can be scanned, if ever beacon connectivity issues should occur
